            <p>Hello and welcome to YourStyleOutlet. We are a genuine and trusted retailer offering high quality clothing at lower prices. We specialise in men's and Ladies ex chain-store, high-street clothing. All of our products come from reputable and trusted wholesalers that we have built strong relationships with over the years.</p>
			<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Ex Highstreet?</span><br />It's pretty simple. Ex high street means that the items we stock may have been cancelled by the chain store or are overstock/surplus stock so will not be sold in the high street store anymore. It may also mean that the styles are now out of season so again are not sold in the high street store any longer. Please note the clothes that we sell are not returns or damaged goods. To comply with regulations, we have cut the labels out and remove the tags. This simply stops people returning items to the original shop for a refund.&nbsp; Please rest assured all items are genuine and brand new!&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Authentic guarantee</span></em><br /> Please note that all our items are 100% authentic. We buy only from reputable designer wear dealers/wholesalers, so please order with confidence. Please check or feedback for reassurance. In some cases tags and labels may have to be removed as a regulation for resale.</p>
